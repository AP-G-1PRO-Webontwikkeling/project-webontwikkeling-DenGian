## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install` to fuel up your spacecraft with all the necessary dependencies for the project. Don't forget to check for any interstellar updates along the way!

2. **Set Up Environment**: Create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` file and add your environment variables. Remember, our secret space sauce is safe with you! Just don't let it fall into the wrong hands...

3. **Start the Server**: Blast off by running `npm start` to fire up the Express server. Your app will be served at `http://localhost:3000` by default. Engage thrusters and prepare for liftoff!

4. **Explore and Enjoy**: Once the server is up and running, navigate the cosmos of CodeVerse Hub. Explore different sections like languages, libraries, and contact pages. Who knows what cosmic wonders await? Remember, the journey is just as important as the destination!

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Stack

- **Express.js**: Our trusty spacecraft for navigating the wild frontier of web applications. With Express.js at the helm, we're ready to soar through the digital cosmos with ease.

- **EJS (Embedded JavaScript)**: A powerful templating engine for generating HTML with the finesse of a cosmic wizard. With EJS, our pages come to life like constellations in the night sky.

- **Tailwind CSS / Flowbite**: The warp drive of our design, allowing us to craft custom interfaces at warp speed. With Tailwind CSS and Flowbite, our designs are as sleek and stylish as a starship on its maiden voyage.

- **dotenv**: Our shield against the vacuum of space, keeping our environment variables safe and sound. With dotenv, our secrets remain secure, hidden away from prying eyes in the depths of space.

### Error Handling üõë

Our cosmic journey through the digital cosmos isn't always smooth sailing. Sometimes, we encounter cosmic anomalies and unexpected asteroid fields that can throw our spacecraft off course. But fear not, fellow space adventurers! With CodeVerse Hub's robust error handling mechanisms, you'll navigate through the darkest corners of space with confidence and grace.

#### Standard HTTP Status Codes üö•

The API follows the standard HTTP status codes for error handling. Here's a quick guide to help you decipher the cosmic signals:

- **404 Not Found**: You've ventured too far into uncharted territory, and the resource you seek eludes your grasp. But fear not, for even in the vast expanse of space, there's always more to discover!

- **500 Internal Server Error**: Uh-oh! It seems we've encountered a cosmic hiccup on our journey. Don't panic; our engineers are hard at work behind the scenes to restore order to the chaos.

#### Custom Error Handling Middleware üõ†Ô∏è

To ensure smooth navigation through the digital cosmos, CodeVerse Hub employs custom error handling middleware. This middleware intercepts errors thrown during the journey and ensures they're gracefully handled, preventing catastrophic system failures.

In the event of an error, the middleware renders custom error pages tailored to each situation. Whether it's a gentle reminder that the resource you seek is beyond the reaches of known space or a reassuring message that our engineers are working tirelessly to restore order, CodeVerse Hub's error handling middleware has you covered.

So strap in, hold on to your space helmets, and prepare for the occasional cosmic turbulence. With CodeVerse Hub's error handling at your side, you'll navigate through the digital cosmos like a seasoned astronaut.
