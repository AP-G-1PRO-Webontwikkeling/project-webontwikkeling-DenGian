    <div class="prose dark:prose-dark">
        <p>Welcome to our ridiculously whimsical terms and conditions page! By accessing this website, you agree to be bound by the following nonsensical terms and conditions. If you do not agree with any of these terms, well... too bad!</p>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><strong>No Cat Videos Allowed:</strong> You are strictly prohibited from uploading or watching any cat videos on this website. Dog videos, however, are highly encouraged.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Mandatory Funny Hat Fridays:</strong> Every Friday, you must wear a funny hat while browsing this website. Failure to comply will result in being tickled by a clown for precisely 3.14 minutes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Keyboard Typing Marathon:</strong> You hereby agree to participate in a 24-hour keyboard typing marathon to test your endurance. The text you'll be typing? The entire script of "Monty Python and the Holy Grail."</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Code Poetry Recital:</strong> Once a month, you must recite a poem written entirely in programming code. Bonus points for using emojis in your code!</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Mandatory Silly Walks:</strong> Whenever you access this website, you must perform a silly walk Ã  la John Cleese from "Monty Python's Flying Circus." Failure to do so will result in your browser being redirected to a compilation of goat yoga videos.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Cookie Consumption Ritual:</strong> Before logging in, you must consume a cookie (the edible kind, not the tracking kind). Vegan and gluten-free options are available upon request.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Debugging Dances:</strong> If you encounter a bug while using this website, you must perform a debugging dance to the tune of "The Safety Dance" by Men Without Hats. Extra points for incorporating semaphore signals into your dance moves.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Whimsical Warranties:</strong> We offer no warranties, express or implied, except for the guarantee that our terms and conditions are the silliest on the internet. If you find sillier terms and conditions, please let us know so we can steal them.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Dragon Adoption:</strong> By agreeing to these terms, you also agree to adopt a virtual dragon companion who will follow you around the website and occasionally breathe virtual fire on annoying pop-up ads.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Pirate Parlay:</strong> In case of disputes, both parties must settle them through a pirate-themed parlay, complete with eye patches, wooden legs, and pirate speak. Arrr!</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Jellybean Jurisdiction:</strong> Any legal matters arising from the use of this website will be settled in a court of law presided over by a judge wearing a robe made entirely of jellybeans. The jury will consist of anthropomorphic gummy bears.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Quantum Quirkiness:</strong> In the event of quantum entanglement causing a temporal loop while using this website, you agree to wear a tinfoil hat and recite the Fibonacci sequence backward until the loop resolves or you attain enlightenment, whichever comes first.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Unicorn Unicornicorn:</strong> If you happen to discover a unicorn browsing this website, you must engage in a conversation with it about the intricacies of quantum physics and exchange unicorn puns. Failure to do so will result in temporary transfiguration into a garden gnome.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
