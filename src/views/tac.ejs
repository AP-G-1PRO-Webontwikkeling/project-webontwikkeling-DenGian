    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Terms and Conditions</h1>
    <div class="prose dark:prose-dark">
        <p>Welcome to our ridiculously whimsical terms and conditions page! By accessing this website, you agree to be bound by the following nonsensical terms and conditions. If you do not agree with any of these terms, well... too bad!</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><strong>No Cat Videos Allowed:</strong> You are strictly prohibited from uploading or watching any cat videos on this website. Dog videos, however, are highly encouraged.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Mandatory Funny Hat Fridays:</strong> Every Friday, you must wear a funny hat while browsing this website. Failure to comply will result in being tickled by a clown for precisely 3.14 minutes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Keyboard Typing Marathon:</strong> You hereby agree to participate in a 24-hour keyboard typing marathon to test your endurance. The text you'll be typing? The entire script of "Monty Python and the Holy Grail."</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Code Poetry Recital:</strong> Once a month, you must recite a poem written entirely in programming code. Bonus points for using emojis in your code!</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Mandatory Silly Walks:</strong> Whenever you access this website, you must perform a silly walk Ã  la John Cleese from "Monty Python's Flying Circus." Failure to do so will result in your browser being redirected to a compilation of goat yoga videos.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Cookie Consumption Ritual:</strong> Before logging in, you must consume a cookie (the edible kind, not the tracking kind). Vegan and gluten-free options are available upon request.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Debugging Dances:</strong> If you encounter a bug while using this website, you must perform a debugging dance to the tune of "The Safety Dance" by Men Without Hats. Extra points for incorporating semaphore signals into your dance moves.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Whimsical Warranties:</strong> We offer no warranties, express or implied, except for the guarantee that our terms and conditions are the silliest on the internet. If you find sillier terms and conditions, please let us know so we can steal them.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>By accessing this website, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to these preposterous terms and conditions. Enjoy your stay and embrace the absurdity!</p>
